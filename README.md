# RiskMirror: Personalized portfolio risk insights &amp; behavioural audit for investors

# RiskMirror

RiskMirror is a simple FinTech MVP that helps retail investors understand their portfolio risk in real-time.  
It provides:

- Market regime analysis using Nifty 50 data
- Portfolio risk score & diversification insights
- Behavioral audit to guide investment decisions
- Easy-to-use, minimal, modern interface

Built with Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and yfinance.  
This is my first public experiment in making finance smarter and more transparent for investors.
